#SUI
###Spynix's UI

This UI code is not particularly robust, nor is it full of the expansive
features found in popular packages.  The purpose of it is to fill a smaller
niche, while including the most popular UI functionality.

##Ideology

Each module should be completely self-sufficient, able to handle its needs.  No
pollution of the DOM, no window globals.  Sometimes it has to be done, but the
idea is to make the intrusion as small as possible.

##License

This UI code is released under the 2-clause ("simplified") BSD license.  The
license is located at ./LICENSE.
